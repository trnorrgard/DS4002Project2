## Does Religion Affect Mental Health?


## Contents Overview:
This repository includes 3 folders:
- The DATA folder contains the .csv file that holds our data as well as a data dictionary
- The FIGURES folder contains the figures produced throughout our analysis
- The SRC folder contains the source code for our analysis

## SRC Folder:
### Installing and Building
Download any files in this section to your local computer. These files are written in R, and it is recommended to use RStudio to execute.

### Usage
- First download the code file(s) from the SRC folder and the .csv file from the  DATA folder.
- The only piece of code that will need to be edited for correct usage is the file path. This appears on line ___ of ___ file. Edit the path provided to the location of where you downloaded the .csv file on your local computer.
- Code should be run line by line if you wish to see all visualizations/plots.

## DATA Folder:

### Data Collection Process
The data we used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, but was originally collected in the form of an open survey available to anyone from years 2017-2019.

### Access
Click this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/yagnavalkya/dass-prediction-based-on-personality-types/data?select=data.csv">link</a> to access data.

### Dictionary

### Data Context
We wanted to test whether or not religion might affect or be a predictor for a person exhibiting symptoms of anxiety or depression. This dataset that we found on Kaggle is sourced from survey responses, which asked participants to rate how much certain statements of mental health symptoms applied to them. Another section of the survey asked for specific answers, such as religion, race, age, gender, etc. We found later that this survey was primarily taken by people living in Malaysia, meaning most responses came from Muslim people. There was still, however, a decent number of responses from other religions, and so we felt comfortable moving forward in testing our hypothesis with this dataset.
